Can you collect data from the API?

$ oc adm top nodes

$ oc adm top pods

$ oc get pod <Pod_Name> -o yaml > pod_yaml.txt

$ oc describe <Pod_Name> > pod_desc.txt

$ oc get pods -A -o wide 

$ oc get all

# curl -kvv https://10.194.30.163:5000/readiness
# curl -kvv http://10.194.30.163:5000/health

Do you experience this slowness in all environments? Just one?

Please collect curl -o /dev/null -s -w 'Total: %{time_total}s\ntime_connect:  %{time_connect}s\n' <console-url>

[+] Try to delete the failing pod/ low in perf pod and check if it runs successfully or not.

Let me know if you have any questions, I will be happy to assist you with it.


The following will collect your etcd metrics for evaluation

~~~
oc project openshift-etcd
for pod in $(oc get pods -n openshift-etcd -l app=etcd -oname); do
 echo "----- $pod -----"
 oc exec $pod -c etcd -- etcdctl endpoint status -w table
 oc exec $pod -c etcd -- etcdctl endpoint status -w json
done
~~~

Let me know if you have any trouble collecting this information.
